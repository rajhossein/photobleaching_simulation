# Pixel Simulation using Gillespie Algorithm

This project simulates the influence of neighboring pixels on the intensity of a central pixel using the Gillespie algorithm. It models various molecular states and tracks photon emissions over time.

## Files and Structure
- **src/gillespie.py**: Core script for running the simulations.
- **data/**: Directory to store input data files.
- **results/**: Directory to store output data files and plots.
- **README.md**: Overview and instructions for the project.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies for the project.
